		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I was born on January 29th, 2002. I live in <b>Dover</b>, Delaware.
		<b>Dover</b> is the capital of our state! It takes me an hour to get to school without 
		traffic.</p>
		<p>I went to Central Middle Public School in <b>Dover.</b> My favorite subject in grade
		school was Math. I like solving problems in class.</p>
		<p>I love sports, I play soccer and field hockey for Padua, and I play club soccer
		for CAFC. I love going to the beach and swimming in the ocean. 
		I love the movie <i>Home.</i> I love the color light blue.
		My favorite quote is <blockquote>Live your life the way you want to live it.</blockquote></p>
