<h2>Haunting History and Information</h2>
	<p>Are you looking for a haunting time? Do you want to experience the fun of a creepy, spooky
nightclub? Well head over to <a href="http://www.bobbymackey.com/" target=_blank>Bobby Mackey's Music World</a>
 in Wilder, Kentucky for a scary time. Bobby Mackey's Music World is a nightclub and 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky-tonk" target=_blank>honky tonk</a> owned by country 
 singer, Bobby Mackey. Legends say the nightclub is the site of murders, suicides and hauntings. 
 It is the most haunted nightclub in America. The site of the Music World was originally a slaughterhouse 
 in the 19th century. The only remains of the original structure is a well that was dug in the 
 basement. This well was was used to gather the drained blood and refuse from the animals. 
 The basement has been said to be a ritual site for occultists, the well was used to hide the remains 
 of the animals they sacrificed.

<h2>Haunted Spirits</h2>
	<p>The site is said to be haunted by spirits including Pearl Bryan, whose corpse was 
	found in a field 2.5 miles from the site. Legends say that her murderers were Satanists 
	who cursed the location and vowed to haunt everyone involved in the case. Scott Jackson 
	and Alonzo Walling threw her head in the infamous well.</p>

	pregnant dancer who committed suicide with poison, after her father murdered her loved one,
	Robert Randall, singer of the club. Her father hung him in the dressing-room. Stories 
	say she attempted to kill her father with the poison, before killing herself. Her body 
	was discovered later in the infamous basement. Johanna is still haunting the basement,

<h2>Reviews</h2>
		<blockquote>My family and I had an amazing time at Bobby Mackey's! We did the 
		haunted ghost tour in the basement, and it was one of the creepiest things I 
		have encountered. My 23 year old son and I really enjoyed hearing the stories of the 
		ghosts that haunt this honkytonk. We had a great time, Highly Recommend!!! <i>James from Ohio.</i>

		<blockquote>This place is everything I expected! I heard so much about it and I hope 
		to make it back soon to spend more time to enjoy the music. We made it just in time 
		to do their last haunted half hour tour of the night and didn't get a chance to hang out 
		for a while. Driving there was a little creepy at night, it's in the middle of nowhere!

		<blockquote>Had a private tour/investigation of Bobby Mackey's! Need I say more! 
		This is a spot on every ghost hunter's Bucket List! We spent about 2 hours covering 
		the building top to bottom.....could have stayed longer! Everyone need to go here at 
		least once! <i>Trisha from Mesa, Arizona.</i></blockquote>

		<blockquote>While there we had the chance to take the 45min tour of the basement 
		and hear some of the history. If you are now asking yourself if we had anything 
		strange happen let me start by saying yes. My boyfriend had a few things happen to him. 
		One of them being a strange noise above him while in the bathroom there is only an attic 
		above there and we confirmed with the staff that there was no one up there at the time. 
		I also had a few things happen to me. One of them being a shadow in one of the corners of the 
		bar. I saw it three different times that night and when I asked the staff who was over in the 
		corner they said that no one was over there. While on the tour I felt like something was following 
		me and I also felt like something was messing with the hairs on my arm. Overall I would 
		go back to Bobby Mackey's. <i>Liz K from Holland, Michigan.</i></blockquote>
